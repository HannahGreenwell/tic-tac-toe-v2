# Take Two: Tic-Tac-Toe

### How To Play
Players take it in turns to select a square on the board. First player to get 3 squares in a row wins. Simple, right!

### Objective
A chance to go back to my first ever GA project and improve on the work flow and solution. Along the way, I also aim to fill in some important gaps that I'm missing (e.g. OOP, a11y, testing etc).

### Approach
- Always seperate the problem solving from the implementation
- RDD/TDD
- Work incrementally - start with MVP and add features later
- Iterate - start with simple solutions and work up to better solutions

### Things I Learnt Along The Way
- CommonJS vs ES6 modules
